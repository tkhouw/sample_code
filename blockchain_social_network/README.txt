This directory contains a simple social network designed to run on the Ethereum blockchain.
It's coded in solidity, the programming language used for Ethereum smart contracts.
I tested the code by deploying my own local blockchain using "Ganache." https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache
This code is based heavily on a tutorial I found on https://www.dappuniversity.com which I highly recommend!  It was great for learning the very basics of coding smart contracts.
